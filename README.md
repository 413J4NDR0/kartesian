# Dynamic Map

This project is an extension of the work I did for a 2017 Information Initiative @ Duke summer project analyzing the dissemination of Syrian Refugee photographs by media outlets. One of the end results were data visualizations I programmed myself in JavaScript using Raphaël JS and JQuery, including interactive SVG maps that could 

* switch between color palettes to show different data, 
* switch between maps of the Mediterranean and the United States,
* display information about Syrian Refugees of a country on hovering,
* display a gallery element on clicking showcasing photographs from the AP database that were published from that country

You can visit the example here: [Summer 2017 Syrian Refugee Map](https://ortega-alejandro.github.io/syrian-refugee-crisis-project/map.html)

This was my first time working with JavaScript, but I spent a significant amount of time in the final weeks of the project refactoring the code for generalizability and would like to continue that work now. 

## To-Do
* Migrate the SVG handler from Raphaël JS to the newer Snap SVG 
* Use a database backend for information from a particular country
* General Refactoring
