# Kartesian
Kartesian is a project for interactive maps emphasizing data visualization and a clean aesthetic. This project is an extension of the JavaScript visualizations I programmed for a project analyzing the Syrian Refugee Crisis, which can be viewed below. Kartesian manipulates SVG representations of countries while accessing a realtime NoSQL database to display information. Currently in the process of adding additional functionality.
